# ASSESSMENT 4: INTRO TO RUBY
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own there is always something more to learn.   

1. In what ways are JavaScript and Ruby similar? In what ways are they different?

  Your answer: Both JS and Ruby are object oriented languages. JS seems to be used on the front end and Ruby is more of a back end language, and i think Ruby may be slower.

  Researched answer: The syntax in these two languages is slightly different. Functions are different. JS can accept mulitple arguments without giving back an error 
    message, with Ruby you have to pass the right number of pareameters or an error will show. JS uses "else if" Ruby uses "elsif". In JS (===) three equals are used  
    to return the value explicity, while in Ruby we use (==) two equals, in JS (==) would compare values regardless of datatype. 



2. What is a hash?

  Your answer: A hash is a collection of data. 

  Researched answer: A hash is a colection of key value pairs that are similar to an array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type. Not an integer 
    index.



3. What is the testing framework used in Ruby? Describe the process of setting up the testing environment.

  Your answer:Rspec is the testing framework for Ruby.

  Researched answer: Rspec is one of the most frequently used testing tool for Ruby. It was created for behavior driven developtment. 



4. Name three possible relationships between objects?

  Your answer: n/a

  Researched answer: Inheritance is a "IS-A" type of relationship. Coposition is a "part-of" type of relationship. Association is a "has-a" type of relashionship. Aggregation is   based on "has-a" type of relationship. 



5. What is an instance variable? How is it different from other variables in Ruby?

  Your answer: n/a

  Researched answer: An instance variable has a name beginning with @, and its scope is confined to whatever object self refers too. Two different objects, even if they belong 
    to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their intance variables.



6. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. [Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)is a list of great resources. Below are a few popular ones:
- [Interactive Ruby Tutorial](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- [Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html): comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries
- [Ruby in 20 Min](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)

Choose one of these resources and look through the material for 10-15 min. List three new things you learned about Ruby:

1) in Ruby (**) is the way to say "to the power of"

2) to find the square root of something you simply use MATH.sqrt()

3)Name identifiers in english.
